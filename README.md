# Advanced Ecommerce Project

## Description
<p>This an advanced Ecommerce project.</p>
<p>It was a hands-on project from YouTube where I followed along and learned a lot about creating models, writing (dynamic) HTML, some JavaScript and Ajax.
Furthermore, I have learned how to integrate Paypal and Stripe and how to test if it works correctly.</p>
<p>The templates I have bought from <a href="https://selar.co/ecommerce-source-code">Selar</a>. Those templates were static, which I made later dynamic.</p>
